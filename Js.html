<p>The code up above does several thinsg. It has a button that changes text in the first 'P' tag and shows the time on the second 
  'p' tag. <br/> The other two buttonschange
  the image that is showing. Javascript can also change, hide and show HTML styles. <br/>
  For example, it can change things like font size by writing "document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "30px"" and it can <br/> hide and show elements by
  changing the display style, which you do by changing 'fontSize' to 'display'. To hide HTML styles, you set the <br/> display to 'none' and for it to show, 
  you change the display to 'block'.</p>
  
<p>There are several ways that you can incorporate JS into a webpage. One of those ways is by adding the 'script' tag into the HTML.<br/>
 You add that tag inside HTMLs body tag, and that'll allow you to code JS in the HTML.</p>

<p>There are three variables in JS. They are var, let and const. var is like the weirdo of all variable types. It isn't as used anymore. let is able to change like <br?
a normal variable, and const is immutable. It cannot change. </p>
