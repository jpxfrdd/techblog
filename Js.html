<p>The code up above does several thinsg. It has a button that changes text in the first 'P' tag and shows the time on the second 
  'p' tag. <br/> The other two buttonschange
  the image that is showing. Javascript can also change, hide and show HTML styles. <br/>
  For example, it can change things like font size by writing "document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "30px"" and it can <br/> hide and show elements by
  changing the display style, which you do by changing 'fontSize' to 'display'. To hide HTML styles, you set the <br/> display to 'none' and for it to show, 
  you change the display to 'block'.</p>
  
<p>JS objects are like arrays, except instead of integers, you have to use words to get a value.</p>

<p>There are several ways that you can incorporate JS into a webpage. One of those ways is by adding the 'script' tag into the HTML.<br/>
 You add that tag inside HTMLs body tag, and that'll allow you to code JS in the HTML.</p>

<p>There are three variables in JS. They are var, let and const. var is like the weirdo of all variable types. It isn't as used anymore. let is able to change like <br/>
a normal variable, and const is immutable. It cannot change. </p>

<p>console.log allows you to write stuff in the console. For example, if you type in 'console.log("im in the console now"),' then it'll <br/> show up
in the console. You could also just use the console.log command as 'console.log(h1)' and it'll print out that whole line of code in the console<br/> 
</p>

<p>The 'for' command allows you to make for loops. For loops are useful for when you are planning to do something over, and over again.
 <br/>For loops begin with the 'for' command, and usually end up looking like this: <br/> <br/>
'for(let i = 1; ithis.value; i){console,log(this,value+)</p>

<p>parseInt is a way to turn strings to actual numbers. For example, this allows you to actually do math in the console</p>

<p>The code up above adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides the two numbers that you put in the two boxes, and gives you the answer in a ul format. <br/>
addEventListeners are bits of code that wait for a certain action to be done, which will toggle another piece of code. The addEventListener in the code above is waiting <br/>
for the button to be clicked, and then when it is clicked, it'll begin to do math with the other javascript commands at the bottom. </p>

<p>Arrays are like python lists. Each value has an order. The command 'console.log(arr.length)' gives you the end of an array, and the command 'console.log(arr[ arr.length - 1])'<br/>
is how you access the end of an array. You can also loop through an array with for loops.  </p>

<p>If statements are toggled when a certain variable or something of the sort is a certain way. For example, IF you are below 16, that means that you can't drive.<br/>
Thats basically how if commands work. And to add on to an if command, then you got to add 'else' at the end of it, so it can do something when the if statement is <br/> 
no longer valid. </p>
